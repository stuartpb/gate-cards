# GATE Cards

This is a system I've devised for handing out assignments at in-person volunteer meetings. Each GATE is a card for a needed action / task, stating that the person assigned should **Get** a specific thing, **At** a specified date, **To** a specific channel or gathering, and what **Else** can happen if that thing isn't gotten.

These cards do *not* have the name of the person or people responsible on them: this is so they can be handed off and passed around freely.

# Anatomy

## Get

This is the [deliverable][] the person is expected to produce. Whatever the task is, it needs to be phrased in terms of a specific deliverable representing its end goal, or it'll never get done: "look into where we might hold our next meeting" is an open-ended task that could be considered "done" by having just looked at the Google Maps result list for "place to have a meeting", but "Scheduled Meeting Time and Reserved Room" makes it clear that the *whole thing* needs to be done (or, if it doesn't, "List of potential places to have the next meeting" makes *that* clear as well).

## At

This is a due date for the task, because, like having a specific Deliverable, if there's no clearly-defined due date, it'll get put off forever. Some things can wait until two months from now, but other things can't, and specifying due dates makes it clear which things are which (and makes it easier to avoid putting off *small* things for that long).

It's the job of whoever's specified in the "To" field to follow up at this due date.

## To

This is where the deliverable should get delivered / announced: it can be either a person, if a single person needed it, or a venue, like "next meeting" or "the mailing list".

Without a specified "To", there's no accountability, and things sit unused.

## Else

This is pretty much the main *novelty* of this format: it's expected that things will fall through, and it's expected that the contingency plan *if the deliverable is not available by the due date* should be defined.

Usually, in my experience, this falls under a few main categories:

- We'll just have to settle for less (eg. using a stock banner instead of a special banner for an event)
- Hand the project off to someone else
- Postponing the thing the task would have been working toward until later

This section is important, as it establishes the **stakes** of the job:

# GATEs on a Plate

By the end of the meeting, these actions should be spread out fairly evenly (nobody should have more than 4 items). For the most optimal engagement in an evening:

- everybody in attendance who's willing and able should be on at least one GATE
- nobody should have more than one more GATE than anybody else
- nobody should be responsible for more than 4 things

Don't feel bad if you're nowhere near this, though. The most important thing, I've found, to avoid burnout and over-concentration of responsibility, is to enforce the no-more-than-4 rule: as meetings fill out with more regular attendees, the items can spill out from them.

This was written from a perspective of monthly meetings: the maximum for items may be fungible depending on scope.

# Recording and Tracking

One easy way to record what the results of the meeting were is to take pictures of each GATE card, with the person or people assigned holding it.

The person in the To for a task should be responsible for tracking things they're supposed to need, but chairs (of meetings or of groups) can also be responsible for accounting for each GATE out of a meeting.

The plate-label.lbx template in this repo is a template for Brother label printers' "P-Touch Editor" software to print rapid prototypes of note cards for writing these tasks down in meetings.
