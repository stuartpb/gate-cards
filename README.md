# PLATE

This is a system I've devised for handing out assignments at volunteer meetings. Each card represents an "action item": by the end of the meeting, these actions should be spread out fairly evenly (nobody should have more than 4 items).

They break each item down to:

## Project

This is the [deliverable][] the person is expected to produce. Whatever the task is, it needs to be phrased in terms of a specific deliverable representing its end goal, or it'll never get done: "look into where we might hold our next meeting" is an open-ended task that could be considered "done" by having just looked at the Google Maps result list for "place to have a meeting", but "Scheduled Meeting Time and Reserved Room" makes it clear that the *whole thing* needs to be done (or, if it doesn't, "List of potential places to have the next meeting" makes *that* clear as well).

### Logic

This is a somewhat weaker concept, and it admittedly just in here to pad out the acronym: the idea of Logic is that it's for contingencies of the given task, where if those things change, the task can be safely abandoned.

## At

This is a due date for the task, because, like having a specific Deliverable, if there's no clearly-defined due date, it'll get put off forever. Some things can wait until two months from now, but other things can't, and specifying due dates makes it clear which things are which (and makes it easier to avoid putting off *small* things for that long).

## To

This is where the deliverable should get delivered / announced: it can be either a person, if a single person needed it, or a venue, like "next meeting" or "the mailing list".

Without a specified "To", there's no accountability, and things sit unused.

## Else

This is pretty much the main *novelty* of this format: it's expected that things will fall through, and it's expected that the contingency plan *if the deliverable is not available by the due date* should be defined.

Usually, in my experience, this falls under a few main categories:

- We'll just have to settle for less (eg. using a stock banner instead of a special banner for an event)
- Hand the project off to someone else
- Reschedule the due date

It's the job of whoever's specified in the "To" field to follow up at this due date.

# Label template

The plate-label.lbx template in this repo is a template for Brother label printers' "P-Touch Editor" software to print rapid prototypes of note cards for writing these tasks down in meetings.
